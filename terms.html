        You must be at least 18 years old, and must not suffer from any disability or impairment which would prevent you from
        assuming the responsibilities contained in the Agreement, or from getting an online ID for fantasy sports. <br>

        1. Introduction <br>
        
        1.1 -These user terms & conditions (the “Agreement”), which includes those terms and conditions expressly set out below
        and those incorporated by reference including the terms of the Privacy Policy and the Game Rules (as defined in section

        1.2 -If any of the terms of the Agreement are determined to be unlawful, invalid, void, or unenforceable for any reason,
        it shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms. Any failure or delay on our part to act or
        exercise any right or remedy with respect to a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by you shall not be
        construed as a waiver of our right to act with respect to the said breach or any prior, concurrent, subsequent or
        similar breaches. <br>
        </span>
        
        2. Agreement <br>

        Agreement, before you may use the Services. You should only use the Services if you have read and understood the
        Agreement and agree to abide by its terms and conditions. If you have any questions about the Agreement please contact
        us. <br>
        
        2.2 -We reserve the right to amend, modify, or change any of the terms of this Agreement at any time, and it is
        advisable to regularly look at these terms. We shall give notice of such changes (“Notice”) either by notification in
        the manner as the Company may deem fit or by posting the amended Agreement on the Platform. Such modifications could
        include changes to any of our Game Rules. If you do not agree with the terms of the amended Agreement, you may terminate
        your use of the Services by notifying us that you wish to terminate your Accounts. Your continued use of the Services
        will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of the changes to the Agreement. <br>
